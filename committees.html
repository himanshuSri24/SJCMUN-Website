			Presenting before you our committee United Nations Human Rights Council.<br>

			The United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) was established by the General Assembly in 2006. UNHRC replaced the Human Rights Commission after much criticism for allowing states to be members who had significant human rights abuses. UNHRC consists of 47 member states that are responsible for supporting and protecting human rights around the world. UNHRC is a subsidiary of the General Assembly and the General Assembly elects the members of UNHRC<br>
			We welcome delegates who keep a keen interest in human rights and have a desire to give solutions to violations all over the world<br>

Presenting before you the most dynamic committee The United Nations Security Council which is the premier decision-making organ of what is considered the highest shrine of international diplomacy. This committee is provincial in nature
<br>
Originally tasked with the responsibility of maintaining peace and security of the world, the Security Council since the 1990s has dramatically expanded its activities to grapple with the social, political and technological changes the 21st century has brought.<br>
This Council holds great power with the authority to impose sanctions, order military operations, mandate arms inspections or deploy election monitor, among others. With its great power, comes the great responsibility of preventing international conflicts and resolving them when the need arises.<br>

We therefore welcome the best in the circuit to come and dominate the committee.
<br>
This committee is the best choice for any individual who actually wants to know about the proceedings of the UNSC with utmost diplomacy.<br>

Presenting before you our next committee,<br>
The All India Political Parties' Meet is a non-statutory, non-legislative as well as non-governmental body that refers to a series of discussions involving representatives from National as well as Regional Political Parties in India. Such a meeting is always called for in situations that require deliberations before or after undertaking any legislative or executive work within the Indian polity. The AIPPM evolves usually on account of certain national events, public reaction or to discuss issues of imminent, national importance.<br>

Even though the AIPPM does not have any bearing with conventional simulations of UN committees, in today's scenario, it is of paramount importance that we educate and acquaint our youth with issues and incidents that concern our country, and to build in them the conscience that they are the future of India.<br>

Committee level: Moderate<br>

Note: The RoP to be followed in the AIPPM remains classified for now; a draft of the same will be attached along with the study guide.<br></p>
